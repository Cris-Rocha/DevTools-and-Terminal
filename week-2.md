# Answering the questions

**1. How do you see the files changed within each commit from git log?**

     On the shell, when we type git log we receive the information  from main :

        The number of commit 
        The author of the commit 
        The date the commit has done 
        And the log/ message it was added to commit the archive

       We receive the same information about the lasts commits made on the repository.
     
     
**2. How do you see the contents of what changed within each file from the git log?**

     When can type  git status on shell  to have an overview of the changes and git diff to show detailed difference.
     
     
**3. What does HEAD refer to in the context of git? (Not to be confused with the "HEAD<<<<" one observes within merge conflict)**

     Head it means you are on the root of the directory ( main ) but also the head always means about the last commit from the branch where we are not
